## 🛡️ Security Commitment

The MentorMinds team takes security seriously. We are committed to protecting the integrity and safety of our smart contracts and the assets they manage. We believe in **responsible disclosure** and appreciate the security research community's help in identifying vulnerabilities.

---

## 📋 Scope

This security policy applies to all MentorMinds smart contracts deployed on Stellar:

### In-Scope Contracts

| Contract                                                        | Status    | Deployment  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Escrow Contract** (`escrow/src/lib.rs`)                       | Pre-audit | Testnet TBD |
| **Verification Contract** (`contracts/verification/src/lib.rs`) | Pre-audit | Testnet TBD |
| **MNT Token Contract** (`contracts/mnt-token/src/lib.rs`)       | Pre-audit | Testnet TBD |
| **Referral Contract** (`contracts/referral/src/lib.rs`)         | Pre-audit | Testnet TBD |

### Out-of-Scope

- Frontend web application (separate repository)
- Backend API services (separate repository)
- Third-party integrations
- Social engineering attacks
- Phishing or physical security attacks
- Attacks that require access to admin private keys

## 🔒 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

### What is Responsible Disclosure?

Responsible disclosure means:

1. **Privately reporting** vulnerabilities to our security team
2. **Allowing reasonable time** for us to investigate and remediate
3. **Coordinating public disclosure** after a fix is available
4. **Acting in good faith** to protect users and the platform

### What We Ask

When you discover a potential vulnerability:

1. **Report immediately** via email to: `security@mentorminds.io`
2. **Include detailed information**:

   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full description of the issue
   - Step-by-step reproduction instructions
   - Affected contract addresses and versions
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested mitigations (if known)

3. **Provide proof of concept** (if possible):

   - Code snippets
   - Transaction hashes (testnet only)
   - Screenshots or videos

4. **Maintain confidentiality**:
   - Do not disclose publicly until we've had time to respond
   - Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond demonstration
   - Do not access funds you don't own

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Do NOT**:

- Exploit vulnerabilities on mainnet deployments
- Attempt to drain funds from escrows
- Launch denial-of-service attacks
- Test phishing campaigns against users
- Submit low-quality or automated reports
- Demand rewards or threaten disclosure

✅ **DO**:

- Act in good faith and with integrity
- Respect user.py and privacy of users
- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations
- Provide us a reasonable time to respond before any public discussion

## 📊 Disclosure Timeline

```
Day 0:    Researcher submits private report
          ↓
Day 0-1:  Security team acknowledges receipt
          ↓
Day 1-3:  Initial triage and severity assessment
          ↓
Day 3-7:  Investigation and reproduction
          ↓
Day 7-14: Fix development and testing
          ↓
Day 14-21: Internal review and deployment to testnet
          ↓
Day 21-30: External audit (if critical/high)
          ↓
Day 30+:  Mainnet deployment and coordinated disclosure
```

### Expedited Timeline

For **Critical** vulnerabilities:

- Immediate escalation to CTO
- Daily status updates
- Emergency patch deployment if needed
- Coordinated disclosure within 7-14 days

### Delayed Disclosure

We may request delayed disclosure when:

- Exploit is actively being developed
- Patch requires complex coordination
- External dependencies need updating
- Regulatory considerations apply

Maximum delay: 90 days from initial report

## Formal Audit Readiness

This section captures the repository-side preparation work needed before a third-party audit engagement begins. It is intended to make external review faster, more repeatable, and easier to scope.

### Current Readiness Package

- documented threat model in `docs/threat-model.md`
- trust assumptions in `docs/trust-assumptions.md`
- attack simulation notes in `docs/attack-simulations.md`
- audit preparation checklist in `docs/security-audit-checklist.md`
- storage and state-machine references in `docs/storage-guide.md` and `docs/state-machines.md`

### Required Pre-Engagement Checklist

- freeze the audit target commit or release tag before sharing artifacts
- publish the in-scope contract list and deployment assumptions
- attach known limitations, privileged roles, and upgrade paths
- include integration and upgrade tests that preserve critical state
- record every post-audit fix in a remediation table before requesting sign-off

### Engagement Output Requirements

- severity-ranked findings with reproduction notes
- explicit confirmation of reviewed contracts and commit hashes
- remediation tracking for every critical, high, and medium issue
- a public summary that links fixes back to the audit report

### Post-Audit Policy

- no major feature merges should land between audit sign-off and production release without re-review
- any change to authorization, fund movement, upgrade flows, or oracle assumptions should trigger an incremental audit review
- follow-up fixes should reference the original audit finding identifiers in their pull requests
## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Researchers

### Testing Guidelines

✅ **Safe Testing Environments**:

- Use local Soroban environment (`soroban env`)
- Deploy to testnet only with small amounts
- Never test on mainnet unless explicitly authorized
- Use provided test fixtures and snapshots

✅ **Recommended Tools**:

- Cargo fuzz testing
- Property-based testing (proptest)
- Static analysis (cargo-clippy, cargo-audit)
- Manual code review with annotation

❌ **Prohibited Activities**:

- Testing on production/mainnet contracts
- Interacting with other users' escrows
- Attempting to profit from discovered bugs
- Sharing exploit code with third parties

### Code Review Focus Areas

Based on our threat model, prioritize:

1. **Authorization Logic**:

   - `require_auth()` calls in privileged functions
   - Admin-only function guards
   - Multi-sig implementation (future)

2. **Financial Calculations**:

   - Fee computation (`platform_fee = amount * fee_bps / 10000`)
   - Dispute split calculations
   - Rounding and truncation behavior

3. **State Transitions**:

   - Escrow status machine (Active → Released/Refunded/Resolved)
   - Double-release prevention
   - Dispute resolution flow

4. **External Calls**:

   - Token contract interactions
   - Cross-contract calls (referral → MNT mint)
   - Reentrancy guards

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Zero/negative amounts
   - Maximum values (i128::MAX)
   - Timestamp boundaries
   - Empty symbols and addresses

**Q: Can I publish my findings after X days?**  
A: Only with explicit permission. Default is coordinated disclosure after fix deployment.

**Q: What if I accidentally exploited a bug?**  
A: Return funds immediately and report it. Good-faith accidents are treated leniently.

**Q: Are competitors eligible for bounties?**  
A: Yes, if they follow responsible disclosure. Competitive intelligence is respected.

**Q: Do you accept anonymous reports?**  
A: Yes, though it complicates reward payment and coordination.
