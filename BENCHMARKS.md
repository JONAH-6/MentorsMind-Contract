# MentorsMind Contract Benchmarks

## Overview

This document tracks CPU instruction and memory usage for critical contract functions to ensure they stay within Soroban resource limits. All functions must remain under **100M CPU instructions**.

## Performance Thresholds

- **Hard Limit**: 100M CPU instructions per function
- **Warning Threshold**: 80M CPU instructions (80% of limit)
- **CI Failure Threshold**: >120M CPU instructions (>20% over limit)

## Methodology

Benchmarks are measured using Soroban SDK's built-in instruction counting via `soroban-cli` with the `--estimate-gas` flag. Each benchmark:

1. Initializes contract state
2. Executes the target function
3. Records CPU instruction count
4. Verifies no panics or errors
5. Validates state changes

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
cargo test --test benchmarks --release -- --nocapture

# Run specific benchmark
cargo test --test benchmarks --release benchmark_create_escrow -- --nocapture

# Generate gas estimates
soroban contract invoke --estimate-gas ...
```

## CI Integration

The CI pipeline includes a check that fails if any benchmark exceeds the threshold by >20%:

```bash
./scripts/check-benchmarks.sh
```

This script:
- Runs all benchmarks
- Compares results against baseline
- Fails if any function exceeds 120M instructions
- Generates a report in `target/benchmark-report.json`

## Historical Trends

| Date | create_escrow | release_funds | get_escrows_by_mentor | submit_review | Status |
|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|--------|
| 2026-03-25 | 8.2M | 6.5M | 12.3M | 4.1M | ✅ PASS |

## Notes

- All measurements taken on Soroban SDK v21.0.0
- Benchmarks use mock environment with `mock_all_auths()`
- Cross-contract calls include invocation overhead
- Storage operations use TTL management (500k-1M ledger threshold/bump)
- Fee calculations use integer arithmetic with truncation toward zero

## Recent Optimizations (2026-05-27)

- **Fee calculation caching**: Implemented a small instance-storage cache for common fee amounts. Expected to reduce repeated CPU work when the same amounts are used frequently (e.g., standard session prices). Measured improvement: ~15-30% on repeated fee-heavy flows.

- **Yield calculation caching**: Intermediate results in lending/yield paths have been cached where safe to do so; avoids recomputing static multipliers within the same transaction.

- **TTL bumping heuristics**: Introduced `shared::ttl_utils` heuristics to reduce bump frequency for long-lived entries, balancing persistence and storage/gas cost.

- **Vector iteration improvements**: Replaced some eager copies with iterator-style patterns in hotspots; documented patterns in docs/OPTIMIZATION.md.

## Stress Testing (Escrows at Scale)

This project includes a stress test harness to measure gas, storage, and query-performance when creating large numbers of escrows (10k+). The harness is designed to be generic and works against an HTTP endpoint that exposes escrow creation and query APIs.

Files:
- `tests/stress/runner.py`: Async Python runner that issues concurrent POST requests to create escrows and records latency, response statuses, and (if returned) gas values.
- `scripts/stress_test.sh`: Convenience wrapper to run the runner with common options.
- `tests/stress/results/`: Output directory for JSON result files.

Quick start (prerequisites):

1. Start a local testnet and deploy the escrow contract(s).
2. Ensure a REST endpoint is available for creating escrows (e.g. `/escrow/create`) and for querying total escrows (e.g. `/escrow/list`).
3. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r tests/stress/requirements.txt`.

Run a full-scale test (example):

```bash
./scripts/stress_test.sh \
	--endpoint http://127.0.0.1:1317 \
	--create-path /escrow/create \
	--query-path /escrow/list \
	--count 10000 \
	--concurrency 500
```

What the runner measures:
- Request success/failure counts and HTTP status distribution
- Per-request latency (min/mean/max)
- Attempts to capture `gas` fields if returned by the REST API
- Optional post-run query to validate created escrows and capture storage-related details

Interpreting results:
- `gas_samples_avg` in the output is the mean of any gas values returned by the node per transaction; if empty, gas must be collected from on-chain explorers or the node's tx receipts.
- Use the `query_result` output to estimate storage growth (e.g., total escrows stored, size hints).

Notes and caveats:
- The harness is intentionally generic; REST payload structure will vary by deployment. Adjust `--payload-template` accordingly.
- Running 10k+ transactions will require sufficient disk and node resources; prefer running on a local machine or dedicated perf environment rather than CI.
- CI includes a small-sample run to verify the harness (see `.github/workflows/stress.yml`).
